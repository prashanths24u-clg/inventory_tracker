📦 Say Goodbye to Spreadsheet Chaos: A Simple Inventory Tracker
Ever get tired of wrestling with clunky spreadsheets to manage your products? I built this straightforward inventory tracker to make life a little easier. It’s a clean and simple web app that helps you add products, track stock, and manage customer orders without the headache.

It's built with a little help from Flask, SQLite, and Bootstrap.

🚀 What It Can Do
Effortless Product Management: Easily add new products, update existing ones, or remove old items in just a few clicks.

Live Stock Tracking: Always know exactly how much you have on hand. As you process orders, the stock levels update automatically.

Smart Low-Stock Alerts: The app highlights products in red when they're running low, so you'll know it's time to reorder before you run out.

Simple Order System: Quickly place new customer orders and view a history of all past orders, neatly sorted by date.

Secure Admin Login: Keep your data safe with a simple username and password system for access.

🛠️ The Tech Behind the Magic
Frontend: Simple HTML and CSS, made to look clean and modern with Bootstrap 5.

Backend: The app is powered by Python using the lightweight and flexible Flask framework.

Database: I used SQLite (with SQLAlchemy) because it's super simple and doesn't require a separate database server. It just works!
